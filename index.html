          <h2>The Need</h2>
          <p>
            The Australian philanthropic and For-Purpose sector is full of great people doing much needed work, yet many still encounter poor levels of transparency when identifying partners, low levels of trust between Funders and For-Purpose organisations and limited options when it comes to accessing capital in a timely way.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our experience at PRD this affects both Funders wishing to co-fund with others and For-Purpose organisations seeking funding and investment to maintain or grow their work for the communities they serve.

              <h3>For Funders</h3>
              <p>
                There is a pressing need to shine a light on the philanthropic sector, improve transparency and help Funders find each other so they can share experiences, learn together, elevate their giving practice, reduce risk and leverage their philanthropic dollar through co-funding partnerships.

              <h3>For For-Purpose Organisations</h3>
              <p>
                Organisations need to understand their funding universe, know who is in their ecosystem and identify those who are interested in funding them, saving tremendous amounts of time and money. Too often they are so busy delivering impact that proactive relationship building is left to chance.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
              We’re all aware that philanthropy is far more relationship based than traditional fundraising, and it’s widely understood that it takes time to cultivate relationships with funder and for purpose organisations. Navigating the sprawling sector with its quirky language, acronyms and nuances can be truly daunting. Sometimes the hardest part is just getting started!
            </p>
            <p>
              We offer a range of engaging philanthropy Workshops for both Funders and For purpose organisations, with customised content that is designed to fast track your learning.

              <h3>Transparency</h3>
              <p>
                Funding partnerships flourish when Funders and For-Purpose organisations align on values. We believe that with greater transparency comes greater understanding, so we help answer questions like "Who is working in the areas that I want to support?" and "Who is likely to be interested in funding the cause that I am working on?".
              </p>
              <p>
                We improve sector transparency by providing information in formats that make it easier to navigate your philanthropy ecosystem and find the right partners.

              <h3>Engagement</h3>
              <p>
                It never ceases to amaze us how often we meet an organisation that is unaware of others doing similar or complementary work. Using a bespoke approach to peer giving and engagement, we connect and convene on behalf of Funders and For-Purpose organisations.
              </p>

                Our tailored funder events establish trusting relationships and shared knowledge, laying the foundations for impactful partnerships.
